## ðŸ›  Installation

Follow the steps below to seamlessly integrate the **Laravel followable package** into your Laravel project.

### 1. Pre-Installation Considerations
Before you begin, ensure you consult the [Prerequisites](/prerequisites) page to check for important requirements and considerations.

This step will help you avoid any potential configuration issues during the installation process.

### 2. Check for Existing Configuration Files
If your application already has a `config/followable.php` file, you must **rename** or **remove** it to avoid conflicts.

This package will publish its own default configuration file, which is essential for customizing the package.

### 3. Install the Package via Composer
To install the Laravel followable package, use Composer â€“ the PHP dependency manager.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash copy
composer require akira-io/laravel-followable
```
This command will download and install the package into your Laravel project.

### 4. Publishing the Configuration File

Once the package is installed via Composer, you can publish the config file. Run the following command:

```bash copy
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="followable-config"
```

This command will publish the packageâ€™s configuration file to your project, allowing you to customize the encryption settings according to your requirements.

### 5. Publish the Migration File and Run Migrations

Next, publish the packageâ€™s migration file by running the following command:

```bash copy
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="followable-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

## ðŸ”‘ Default Configuration File

Once the package is installed, you can view the default configuration file contents by visiting the [Config file](/config) section.
