### Local Testing

To test the Package locally on your system, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**

If you haven’t already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/akira-io/laravel-followable.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer:

```bash copy
cd laravel-followable
composer install
```

3. **Link the page locally**

To link the package locally, use Laravel’s package:discover command. This allows you to test the package without having to push it to a remote repository.

Run the following command to discover the package:

```bash copy
composer dump-autoload
```

Alternatively, you can use the path repository method in your main Laravel project’s composer.json file:

```json copy
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "/path/to/laravel-followable"
    }
]
```
Then, run the following command:

```bash copy
composer require akira-io/laravel-followable
```

the installation process was covered in the [Installation](/installation) section.
