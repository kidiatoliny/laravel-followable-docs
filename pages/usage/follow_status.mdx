The Follower::attachFollowStatus() method is a powerful feature that allows you to easily attach the current user’s follow status to a given collection of followable models. This method adds a has_followed attribute to each item in the collection, indicating whether the current user follows that particular model.

### For a Single Model
You can attach the follow status to a single model, which will return a model with the has_followed attribute.

```php
$user1 = User::find(1);

// Attach follow status to a single model
$user->attachFollowStatus($user1);
```
The result will include the has_followed attribute, which tells whether the current user follows the given model:

```php
{
   //...
  "has_followed": true
   //...
}
```
### For Collections, Paginators, LengthAwarePaginators, and Arrays

You can also attach the follow status to a collection of models, paginators, length-aware paginators, or arrays.
This will add the has_followed attribute to each item in the collection.

```php
$user = auth()->user();

$users = User::oldest('id')->get();

// Attach follow status to a collection of users
$users = $user->attachFollowStatus($users);

// Convert to array for easier use
$users = $users->toArray();
```

The follow status will be added to each user in the collection:

```php
[
    {
        //...
        "has_followed": true
        //...
    },
    {
        //...
        "has_followed": false
        //...
    }
]
```

### For Pagination

You can also use attachFollowStatus on paginated results, so when you’re working with pagination, the follow status is added seamlessly.

```php
$users = User::paginate(20);

// Attach follow status to the paginated users
$user->attachFollowStatus($users);

// Access follow status for each user
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->has_followed ? 'User follows this model' : 'User does not follow this model';
}
```
