This section explains how to retrieve a user’s followers using the Laravel Followable package.
Whether you need to fetch all followers, approved followers, or non-approved followers, this guide will help you implement this functionality with ease.


### Retrieving Followers

To get all the users following the current user, simply access the followers attribute. This will return a collection of all followers, which may include both approved and non-approved relationships.

```php
$user->followers;
```

This will return all followers of the user, including those who have not been approved yet.


### Retrieving Approved Followers

To get only the followers that have been approved by the user, use the approvedFollowers method:

```php
$user->approvedFollowers;
```

This will return only the followers who have been accepted by the user, meaning the follow request has been approved.


### Retrieving Non-Approved Followers

If you want to fetch the followers that have not yet been approved by the user, use the notApprovedFollowers method:

```php
$user->notApprovedFollowers;
```

This collection will contain all follow requests that the user has received but not yet accepted or rejected.


### Looping Through Followers

You can loop through the followers to extract more details about each relationship. Here’s how you can get the created_at date (the date the user was followed) and access additional attributes of the follower model (like the user’s nickname).

```php
    foreach ($user->followers()->with('follower')->get() as $follower) {
    // Date when the user was followed
    $follower->created_at;

    // Accessing the follower's attributes
    $follower->follower->name;
}
```
