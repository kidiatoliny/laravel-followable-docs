## Prepare your Model

Before you can start using the **Laravel Followable** package, you need to prepare your model to enable the `follow` and `unfollow` functionality.

This section will guide you through the steps required to set up your model for following and unfollowing.


### 1. Add the `Follower` Trait  to  your follower model

To make your model a follower, you need to add the `Follower` trait to it.

This trait provides the necessary methods to manage followers and followable models.

Here's an example of how you can add the `Follower` trait to your model:

```php

<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

use Akira\Followable\Traits\Follower;

class User extends Model
{
    use Follower;

    // Your model's code here
}
```


### 2. Add the `Followable` Trait

To make your model followable, you need to add the `Followable` trait to it.

This trait provides the necessary methods to manage followers and followable models.

Here's an example of how you can add the `Followable` trait to your model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

use Akira\Followable\Traits\Followable;

class User extends Model
{
    use Followable;

    // Your model's code here
}
```

### The `Follower` trait will add the following methods to your model:

- `follow(Models $model)`: Follow the given model.
- `unfollow(Models $model)`: Unfollow the given model.
- `toggleFollow(Models $model)`: Toggle the follow status of the given model.
- `isFollowing(Models $model)`: Check if the model is following the given model.
- `hasRequestedToFollow(Models $model)`: Check if the model has requested to follow the given model.
- `followings()`: Get the models that the model is following.
- `approvedFollowings()`: Get the models that the model is following and have approved the follow request.
- `notApprovedFollowings()`: Get the models that the model is following but have not approved the follow request.
- `attachFollowStatus($followables, ?callable $resolver=null, bool $returnFirst=false)`: Attach the follow status to the given followables.



###  The `Followable` trait will add the following methods to your model:

- `needsToApproveFollowRequest()`: Check if the model needs to approve follow requests.
- `rejectFollowRequestFrom(Models $follower)`: Reject the follow request from the given model.
- `approveFollowRequestFrom(Models $follower)`: Approve the follow request from the given model.
- `isFollowedBy(Models $follower)`: Check if the model is followed by the given model.
- `orderByFollowersCount($query, string $direction = 'desc')`: Order the models by the number of followers.
- `orderByFollowersCountDesc($query)`: Order the models by the number of followers in descending order.
- `orderByFollowersCountAsc($query)`: Order the models by the number of followers in ascending order.
- `followables()`: Get the models that are following the model.
- `followers()`: Get the models that are following the model and have been approved.
- `approvedFollowers()`: Get the models that are following the model and have been approved.
- `notApprovedFollowers()`: Get the models that are following the model but have not been approved.
