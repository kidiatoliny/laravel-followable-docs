Before you begin the installation process, make sure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

### Laravel Version

This package is compatible with **Laravel 11** or higher.

We recommend using the latest stable version of Laravel for optimal performance and security.

If you're using a different version of Laravel, please refer to the [Installing on Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master/installation#main-content) page to check compatibility with various Laravel versions.

### PHP Version

This package requires **PHP 8.4** or higher. Make sure your PHP version meets this requirement for smooth functionality.

To check your current PHP version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash copy
php -v
```

If your PHP version is below 8.4, you may need to upgrade to the latest stable version to fully utilize this packageâ€™s features.

### Additional Considerations

In addition to the core prerequisites, keep the following in mind for an optimal setup:

- **Composer**: Make sure **Composer** is installed and properly configured on your system. Composer is an essential tool for managing PHP dependencies, including Laravel packages like `akira/laravel-followable`.

If you haven't already, you can install Composer by following the instructions on their [official website](https://getcomposer.org).
